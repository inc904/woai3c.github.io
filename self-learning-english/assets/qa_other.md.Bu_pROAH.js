We are a team that leans towards front-end development with limited back-end resources. Sometimes, when there&#39;s a shortage of back-end resources and no one to write the interfaces, the front-end developers have to wait. To change this situation, I advocated for the use of NestJS in our team. This allowed front-end developers to write back-end code. As a result, our project progress was not stalled due to a lack of back-end resources, and it also improved the technical skills and broadened the technical perspective of our team members.</p><details><summary>查看中文</summary> 描述一次您推动技术革新或实施新工具的经历，以及这对项目和团队产生的影响。 <p>我描述一下在团队中推广 Nestjs 的经历。因为我们团队是一个偏前端的团队，后端人员比较少。有时候后端资源不足的情况下，接口没人写，前端人员就得空等着。所以为了改变这种情况。我就在团队里推广使用 Nestjs，让前端也能写后端代码。不会因为缺少后端而阻塞项目进度，而且还能提升团队成员的技术水平和技术视野。</p></details><h2 id="could-you-elaborate-on-the-core-functionalities-of-the-compiler-you-developed-and-some-technical-challenges-you-faced-during-the-process" tabindex="-1">Could you elaborate on the core functionalities of the compiler you developed and some technical challenges you faced during the process? <a class="header-anchor" href="#could-you-elaborate-on-the-core-functionalities-of-the-compiler-you-developed-and-some-technical-challenges-you-faced-during-the-process" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Could you elaborate on the core functionalities of the compiler you developed and some technical challenges you faced during the process?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The primary function of a compiler is to transform user-written code into target code. This process involves lexical analysis, syntax analysis, semantic analysis, and code generation. During my development work, I encountered challenges mainly in syntax analysis and code generation. For example, transforming code into tokens, creating an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) from those tokens, and then converting the AST into target code. This required the application of various algorithms and data structures, such as recursive descent and LL parsing algorithms.</p><details><summary>查看中文</summary> 能否详细阐述一下该编译器实现的核心功能和您在编写过程中遇到的一些技术挑战？ <p>编译器的核心功能是将用户输入的代码转换成目标代码，这个过程中会涉及到词法分析、语法分析、语义分析、代码生成等步骤。我在编写过程中遇到的技术挑战主要是语法分析和代码生成。比如如何将代码转化为 token，再根据 token 生成 AST，然后根据 AST 生成目标代码。这个过程中会涉及到很多算法和数据结构，例如递归下降、LL 算法等。</p></details><h2 id="can-you-give-an-example-of-a-specific-technical-issue-encountered-in-cross-platform-development-and-how-you-solved-it" tabindex="-1">Can you give an example of a specific technical issue encountered in cross-platform development and how you solved it? <a class="header-anchor" href="#can-you-give-an-example-of-a-specific-technical-issue-encountered-in-cross-platform-development-and-how-you-solved-it" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Can you give an example of a specific technical issue encountered in cross-platform development and how you solved it?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>One commonly encountered issue in cross-platform development is compatibility.

This includes things like the number of spaces for indentation, whether to add semicolons at the end of code lines, and the position of braces after functions. Additionally, habits for file naming and directory structure can also vary. If team members each follow their own habits for coding and naming files, it can lead to confusion and affect team communication and work atmosphere. Therefore, unifying technical specifications allows everyone to work under the same rules. This can reduce unnecessary communication costs and improve development efficiency.</p><details><summary>查看中文</summary> 为什么要制定团队技术规范，它带来了哪些好处？ <p>一般情况下，不同的程序员可能各自有不同的编码风格，例如缩进使用空格的数量、代码行末是否加分号、函数后大括号的位置等。此外，文件命名和目录结构也可能各有不同的习惯。如果团队成员各自为政，按照自己的习惯编写代码和命名文件，可能会造成混乱，影响团队沟通和工作氛围。因此，统一技术规范，让每个人在相同的规则下工作，能够减少不必要的沟通成本，提高开发效率。</p></details><h2 id="regarding-code-quality-how-do-you-ensure-and-assess-the-quality-of-code-produced-by-your-team-what-tools-and-processes-have-you-used" tabindex="-1">Regarding code quality, how do you ensure and assess the quality of code produced by your team?
